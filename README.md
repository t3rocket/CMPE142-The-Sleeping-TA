# CMPE142-The-Sleeping-TA
SJSU CmpE 142 "Sleeping TA" programming project

b) Implementation a.k.a Coding

Implement the project and submit source files. In addition, prepare and submit a report. The report should clearly describe how to compile the project in command line and how to run it. Mention a few test cases that can be run on your program. The report should include the output of the program, if the programming project specified it. Name the report file as report.pdf. Compress the source files, and the report as a ZIP file and upload it on Canvas.

In summary:
●	Use C or Java programming languages for implementation
●	The report should consist of:
○	Instructions to compile and run your source files
○	Test cases that can be inputted to the program
○	Output of the program if the programming assignment instructions specified it
●	Name the report file report.pdf


You should start coding the assignment at the beginning of week 2 or even earlier.  That gives you two weeks to complete the assignment. In other words, do not wait till week 3 to start coding. 2 a), b) are really concurrent tasks.
